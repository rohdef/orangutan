# Orangutan

Currently not much to see, only proof of concept scripts

## The name orangutan

Actually just a work in progress name.  It's inspired by The Librarian
from Discworld, whom I found a good metaphor for keeping track of a
library :)

## Helper tools

There's a simple tool to keep track of callbacks that I named
'weatherwax' also inspired from Discworld.  It's just a simple script
to enable having a lot of callbacks that all need to be called before
calling the final callback.

Another tool is banana (the orangutan needs something to eat), which
is small helper functions, for instance to process an array of
functions and deep merging objects.

Lastly inside the tests there's lipwig which is for the gritty details
in the tests

## bibtex-parser-js

The bibtex-parser-js is a slightly modified version of the one in the
npm librariesm, to accomodate the needs for parsing BibTeX in this
project.
